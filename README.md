## Project Overview 

Rapido Ride Data Analysis.<br>

This project analyzes real-world ride booking data from Rapido, a popular ride-hailing platform in India. The dataset captures detailed information about individual rides, including service type, ride status, trip distance, duration, fares, and payment methods.<br>
The goal of this project is to understand ride patterns, revenue behavior, cancellations, and customer payment preferences using structured data analysis techniques. This project demonstrates how raw operational data can be transformed into business insights that support decision-making.

	•	Total Cancelled Rides: ~5.0K<br>
  
  🔍 **Key Insights**<br>
	•	The platform recorded approximately 5,000 cancelled rides, which is a material volume compared to completed rides.<br>
	•	The average revenue per completed ride is approximately ₹547.<br>
	•	If cancelled rides had been completed at the average fare, the potential revenue impact is ~₹27.6 lakh.<br>
  
  🎯 **Business Recommendations**

Q.2 Which service (Auto vs Cab) generates higher revenue per ride, and which has higher cancellation rate?<br>
Ans -<br>
**Auto vs Bike vs Cab Economy Comparison**

| Service Type |(RPR) Revenue per Ride (₹) | Cancellation Rate (%)  |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Auto         | 548.83                    | 9.84%                  |
| Cab Economy  | 547.25                    | 10.33%                 |
| Bike         | 547.85                    | 10.32%                 |
| Parcel	   | 546.39                    | 9.55%                  | 

**Insight**<br>
* Auto delivers the highest revenue per ride (₹548.83) while also maintaining the lowest cancellation rate (9.84%), making it the most efficient service segment.<br>
* Cab Economy shows the highest cancellation rate (10.33%), representing the largest source of potential revenue leakage due to its high ride volume.<br>

🎯 **Business Recommendations**<br>
1. Prioritize reduction of Cab Economy cancellations, as even a small improvement in completion rate can unlock meaningful revenue recovery due to its scale.<br>
2. Protect and scale Auto service performance, since it combines high revenue per ride with operational stability.<br>
3. Track Revenue per Ride and Cancellation Rate together as core KPIs to balance growth and efficiency across service types.<br>
